The open-source configuration mapping in DPQKET.

# The open-source configuration mapping in DPQKET serves as the underlying mapping structure for the world's fastest fully homomorphic encryption computing technology. It is designed based on schemes such as the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Users can set parameters within this structure to construct specific homomorphic configuration mappings, integrate corresponding components, and appropriately combine them in accordance with Nakayama's lemma. Subsequently, by selecting corresponding innovative cryptographic algorithm modules based on the model characteristics and frequency requirements of the application scenario, a customized DPQKET privacy-preserving computing technical solution can be ultimately assembled.
